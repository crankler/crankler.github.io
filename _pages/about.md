Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm currently pursing my Robotics Ph.D. (Sep.2020 - Jun.2024) from the [Robotics Institute](https://mee.sustech.edu.cn/en/) at [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/), Shenzhen, China, working with [Zhenzhong Jia](https://mee.sustech.edu.cn/2019/jiaoshou4_0930/842.html).
My research focuses on **Terrain-aware Contact and Mapping for Intelligent Robots**, which explores perception, learning, sensor fusion, and autonomous traversal in more dynamic areas.
<!-- My goal: Towards Pervasive Robotics and Artificial Intelligence -->

<!-- I graduated with an Mphil from the  -->
I finished my master's degree (Sep.2017 - Dec.2019) in Robotics at Harbin Institute Of Technology, Shenzhen, supervised by Prof. [Wenfu Xu](http://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/xuwenfu).
Prior to that, I obtained a B.Eng (Sep.2013 - Jun.2017) from Harbin Institute Of Technology, Harbin, also studying Robotics.
During my Ph.D. I joined RCAMC as a visiting researcherand collaborate with Prof. [Liang Ding](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/liangding)(03.2023-09.2023) and Prof. [Hongwei Guo](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/guohongwei?lang=zh)(09.2023-02.2024) at HIT.
<!-- During my Ph.D. I collaborate with the [MetaSLAM](https://metaslam.github.io/) by Prof. Peng Yin at GairLab.  -->
<!-- ([HITSZ](http://en.hitsz.edu.cn/)) -->
<!-- ([HIT](http://www.hit.edu.cn/))-->


I am always happy to discuss and exchange research ideas in robotics.
<!-- **You can check my reseach [TAIL Robots](https://tailrobot.github.io/) for the latest news and more details.** -->
By the way, **I'm looking for Postdoc position now**, if you are interested in my research, plese feel free to contact me.




<!-- My research focues includes: dynamic perception in complex surroundings integrated learning manner and interaction-aware navigation for spatial AI form contact-based sensors. -->
<!-- My research goal is to implement human-level intelligient robots that can traveling more dynamic areas, which can help to create a better future and enjoy this process. 
I am broadly interested in Robotics, Computer Vision and Machine Learning. Specifically, my research focuses on robot perception, robot learning, and autonomous navigation. My group explores the use of computer vision, machine learning, estimation, probabilistic inference, kinematics and dynamics to develop autonomous systems in ground, air, and space applications.-->

<!-- I am doing my Ph.D. in robotics at the Robotic Systems Lab at **ETH Zurich** and the **Max Planck Institute** for Intelligent Systems, co-advised by Marco Hutter and Georg Martius.
My research focuses on **Learning Perception and Navigation for Legged Robots**.

During my Bachelor's, I worked at the chair for **High Performance Humanoid Technologies** with Prof. Tamim Asfour (KIT, Germany) and conducted my Bachelor's Thesis with Prof. Takamitsu Matsubara in Japan (NAIST, Japan).
I worked as a **Collaborative Robotics Engineer** at SEW-Eurodrive before starting my Master's in **Robotics Systems and Control** at ETH Zurich. Throughout my Master's I was supervised by Prof. Roland Siegwart and spent most of my time at the **Autonmous Systems Lab**.

During my Ph.D. I joined **NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory** as a visiting researcher and continuously collaborate with the Dynamic Robotic Systems Group by Prof. Maurice Fallon at **University of Oxford**.
