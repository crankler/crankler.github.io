I was a Teaching Assistant for the undergraduate-level course **ME 5115: Autonomous Robotic Systems** held at the Southern University of Science and Technology, taught by Prof. Zhenzhong Jia. I have developed lab materials and hosted lab sessions for this course.
<!-- Topics include Bayesian filtering; stochastic representations of the environment; motion and sensor models for mobile robots; algorithms for mapping, localization; application to autonomous marine, ground, and air vehicles. -->
