I was one of the Teaching Assistant for a new undergraduate-level robotics course **ME 434: Walking Robots** held at the Southern University of Science and Technology, taught by [Prof. Chenglong Fu](https://mee.sustech.edu.cn/jiaozhiyuangong/891.html). I have developed lab materials and hosted lab sessions for this course.
<!-- Topics include Bayesian filtering; stochastic representations of the environment; motion and sensor models for mobile robots; algorithms for mapping, localization; application to autonomous marine, ground, and air vehicles. -->

<!-- 
I was one of the course developers for a new undergraduate-level robotics course **ROB 101: Computational Linear Algebra (Fall 2020)** at the University of Michigan, taught by [Prof. Jessy Grizzle](https://ece.umich.edu/faculty/grizzle/). The course was has been awarded [Provost's Teaching Innovation Prize](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/stories/provosts-teaching-innovation-prize-for-new-robotics-course-that-focuses-on-equitable-education) and highlighted on [The University Record](https://record.umich.edu/articles/six-projects-to-be-awarded-provosts-teaching-innovation-prizes/) in 2021 for focusing on equitable eduation. -->
